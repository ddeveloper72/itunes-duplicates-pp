# Mini project, using python tool to find duplicates in an iTunes playlist


This mini-project is a replication of work done by [Electronut Labs](http://electronut.in/)
I came across this work, in an eBook, called Python [Playground: Geeky Projects for the Curious Programmer](https://g.co/kgs/quxp9B)
I've done this for the simple pure enjoyment factor of working with Python

The application analyses an iTunes (.xml) and returns a txt file, containing the duplicate titles of tracks from the playlist.

The application also returns two graphs, plotting a comparison of  the track rating vs track duration as well as count of tracks vs the Track duration.  See the figure below.
